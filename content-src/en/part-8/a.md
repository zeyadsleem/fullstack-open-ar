In this part, we will explore GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST for implementing server interfaces. We will learn the core concepts of GraphQL, including schemas, queries, mutations, and subscriptions, and build a GraphQL server using Apollo Server. On the frontend, we will connect a React application to the GraphQL backend using Apollo Client, handling data fetching, caching, and state management. We will also add a database and user authentication to the backend, and finish by looking at advanced topics such as optimizing queries.

## Prerequisites

This part relies on core JavaScript and React skills from the earlier parts, as well as experience building server-side applications with Node.js. Before starting this part you should be comfortable with React component patterns, managing state, and making HTTP requests from the frontend. On the backend side, you should understand how to structure a Node.js application, connect to a database, and implement user authentication. It is recommended that you finish at least parts 0 to 5 before starting this part.

## Enrollment

You do not need to enroll to study in the course. You can enroll only after you have completed the course, see the&nbsp;<em>Getting ECTS credits and the certificate</em>&nbsp;below.

## Help with exercises or course practicalities

This course has a Discord group where we discuss everything about the course. Support is available almost 24/7, with the discussion being in both English and Finnish.

Join our Full stack open Discord channel: <a href="https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/fullstack">https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/fullstack</a>

<em><strong>All</strong>&nbsp;inappropriate, degrading, or discriminatory comments on the channel are prohibited and will lead to action taken against the commenter.</em>

## Submitting exercises

This course part contains 29 exercises, and most of them must be completed in order to receive a grade. Some of the tasks are optional, and the optionality is clearly marked in the course material.

The exercises are to be submitted to <em>a new GitHub repository,</em> which will include all of the source code and the configurations that you do during this part. If you are using a private repository, add the GitHub user <em>mluukkai</em> as a collaborator.

<strong>Your exercises are reviewed after you submit the last exercise, and if everything is more or less ok, you will be graded, and the certificate and university credits will be available to you.</strong>

> Remember not to cheat in exercises! If, for example, multiple students are submitting the same code, the issue is handled according to the <a href="https://studies.helsinki.fi/instructions/article/what-cheating-and-plagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">policy on plagiarism</a> of the University of Helsinki.

## Locking a chapter

Once you have finished all exercises in a chapter, you must lock the chapter before continuing to the next one. Keep in mind that after locking a chapter, you won’t be able to submit any further exercises for it, so only lock it when everything is done.

The&nbsp;<em>Locking a chapter</em>&nbsp;activity looks like this:

## Getting ECTS credits and the certificate

After you have completed the exercises and those are graded, you can get the ECTS credits as follows

#### University of Helsinki degree students and exchange students
1. Enroll directly through your Sisu account (Sisu: Structure of studies).
2. Complete all required exercises.

#### Others
1. Complete all required exercises.
2. Go to the course front page.
3. Scroll down until you see an element that says <em>Congratulations</em>!
4. Click the <em>REGISTER</em><em> </em> button.
5. Fill in the open university (University of Helsinki) enrolment form. Use the same email address that you used to complete the course.
6. The credits are usually registered in the University of Helsinki’s study register within two days of enrolment.

Registering the credits takes usually two days.

The course certificate is available also at the course front page.

## Using LLM:s

Large language models have become powerful tools in software development, and coding agents push those capabilities even further. They can make a course like this feel almost effortless—but relying on them too heavily comes at a cost. To use AI effectively, you still need a solid command of the fundamentals. That’s why I suggest using agents in moderation, especially for explanations and debugging, so you build real understanding rather than outsourcing the learning.

A practical, learning-first approach to using AI on this course:

Before using AI
- Try on your own first: write a solution or at least sketch your approach.
- Pinpoint the problem: identify the exact error message, unclear concept, or design trade-off you’re stuck on.

How to use AI wisely
- Explanations: ask for clear explanations of concepts or code (why something works, not just how).
- Debugging: share the error, the relevant code, and what you’ve already tried; ask for hypotheses and possible fixes.
- Peer review: request feedback on your solution, edge cases, complexity, and alternatives.
- Design support: ask to break the problem into parts, propose test cases, and define success metrics.

What to avoid
- Copying complete solutions without understanding them.
- Overly broad requests (“write the entire assignment”) that short-circuit your learning.
- Relying on a single answer without verification or tests.

Bottom line: let AI be your explainer, reviewer, and debugging partner—not your substitute for thinking and practice.
